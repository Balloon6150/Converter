Welcome to my Readme!;
My project is a simple yet effective (probably) website using HTML with seperate CSS and JS files.
My demo is found in the link provided in highseas ship. 
If the demo link doesnt work start the file through a code editor such as VS code and click Run/Demon while on the HTML document (It links the Css and Js files together)
Have Fun and a Happy holidays (If you celebrate the new year and chrismas and other winter holidays)
